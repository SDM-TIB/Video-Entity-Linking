# Video-Entity-Linking
This repository consists of scripts, dataset files, and algorithm for generating knowledge-graph using [ActivityNet-Entity](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ActivityNet-Entities) dataset. We are using [Falcon 2.0](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/falcon2.0) tool for entity recognition and linking tasks with Wiki-data. 

(All the structured data files and script files will be uploaded very soon).
