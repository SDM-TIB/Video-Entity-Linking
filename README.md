# ActivityNet-EKG

### Introduction
This repository consists of scripts, dataset files, unified schema, and rml files for generating ActivityNet-EKG knowledge graph. Video-Textual-Knowledge-Entity-Linking, known as ActivityNet-EKG contains video short clips and is associated with descriptions (captions) in which visual objects and textual entities are aligned with entity mentions in their corresponding classes (types) in knowledge bases called DBpedia and Wikidata. The ActivityNet-EKG knowledge graph can open new research directions and can used to solve the problems of multimedia processing, indexing, and retrieval tasks, e.g., information extraction from [video-text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320303004175), [video questions answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01696), [video captioning](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/courses/ics-295/fall-2019/presentations/Porhemmat.pdf), and [video dialogue systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01166).

The below Figure shows how the vision and language parts come to form three segments with captions describing the video contents. The knowledge base (KB) part represents the recognized and linked entities in the same colors with corresponding classes (types) in the KB and represents their actual DBpedia linked in the table.
